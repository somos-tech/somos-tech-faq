# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## ⚠️ Important Notice: US Service Availability

SOMOS.tech services are currently only available to users located in the United States.

As part of our cost reduction efforts for AI programs and infrastructure optimization, we have implemented geographic restrictions on our platform. Access to SOMOS.tech is limited to users within the United States only.

### Why this restriction?

- AI Cost Management: Azure AI and OpenAI services incur significant costs. Limiting to US traffic helps us manage these expenses while maintaining service quality.
- Compliance & Optimization: Geographic restrictions allow us to optimize infrastructure costs and ensure compliance with regional requirements.
- Future Expansion: We are actively evaluating options to expand service availability to other regions as funding and resources allow.

### What if I’m outside the US?

Currently, access from outside the United States will be blocked.
